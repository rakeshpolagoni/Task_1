## Summary (one paragraph)
i have a resposive web app using  bootstrap where it conatins index.html,about.html, contact.html pages and i added bootstrap via CDN

## How I built it (step-by-step)
1. Created project scaffold with `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`.
2. Added Bootstrap 5 via CDN.
3. Built responsive Navbar, Hero, Cards, and Contact Form using Bootstrap components and utility classes.
4. Polished spacing, colors, and text with a small custom CSS file.
5. Deployed on GitHub Pages/Netlify.

## What I used
- Bootstrap 5 (via CDN)
- HTML5, CSS3
- Git & GitHub
- Deployed to GitHub Pages / Netlify

## Did I use AI or external help?
- e.g., "I used ChatGPT for scaffolding and small snippets; I referenced Bootstrap docs for component usage and modified snippets to create original composition."

## Challenges & Solutions
- Challenge 1: e.g., spacing on mobile. Solution: used `py-` utilities and `flex` utilities.
- Challenge 2: e.g., Netlify form not capturing. Solution: added `name="form-name"` hidden input and re-deployed.

## Time taken
- Start: YYYY-MM-DD
- End: YYYY-MM-DD
- Total time: X hours (or X days)

## Future improvements
- Add accessible ARIA labels
